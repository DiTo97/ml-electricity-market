<b>Abstract</b>

We present a pair-project in which we tackle the same problem proposed by the
IREN company during C1A0 Hackathon. We tried to mix project of types 1 and 2
with the aim of considering a full real-case scenario concerning the electricity market.
As for the type 2 part of the project, we provide a detailed data processing and a
simple time-series analysis in the notebook file Code/Data processing/Time-series
analysis.ipynb. As for the type 1 part of the project, a detailed formulation of two
different algorithms follows: Random forests (by Gianvito Losapio) and Gradient
boosting (by Federico Minutoli). Both of the algorithms have been implemented from scratch.
The structure of the code is presented in the notebook file Code/Problem.ipynb as
well as its use to solve the main problem. Results and comparisons of the methods
are provided.
